    <h4> <span> Wakefield College IT Systems Quiz </span></h4>
    <h3> 
        In my second year college independent project module I produced my largest scale project to test first year students. 
        <br> It quizzes users on their knowledge of their first year exam module using unique user accounts. 
        <br> The question are picked in a random order so no two quizzes are the same. 
        <br> Scores are recored to be displayed on a sorted scoreboard.

    <h4> <span> Volunteer Shift Management System </span></h4>
    <h3> 
        In the summer of 2024 I developed a system for volunteers to sign onto shifts in React Native. 
        <br> Volunteers can sign onto shifts appropriate for their role and see information about their shifts.
        <br> They can then do training for their shifts which can be reading legislation or watching a training video. 
    </h3>

    <h4> <span> Python Machine Learning Program </span></h4>
    <h3>
        In the summer of 2024 I also developed a machine learning program to make predictions based on provided data.
        <br> The early version was used to predict the preferred music taste of a person based on their age and gender.
        <br> The more complicated version predicts the price of plane tickets based on trends over periods of time.
